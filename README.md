Group Work

I found this work quite complex, and I had time problems developing it due to the complex schedule in connection with other lessons. But nevertheless, it was a very pleasant project and, in my opinion, very important for me and my development in the future.
  Despite the fact that I have been studying at this university for the third year, I still consider myself a beginner in coding, since before this I had absolutely no experience in this field.  
Therefore, working in a group, and the help of people who understand this more, is important, contributes to progress,  although sometimes I am embarrassed to be worse. Although because my member got sick in the last days, we didnâ€™t have time to work together much time. 
But still, we managed to discuss and look together at some details of the project at the beginning of development, which was to my benefit.
